Usage: stripcomments [OPTION]... [FILE/GLOB]...

If no FILE(s) are specified, it will default to stdin (if data is available).

Strip comments from FILE(s) and:
- print to stdout (default),
- overwrite the FILE(s), or
- save FILE(s) to another directory

OPTIONS:
-w, --write          Overwrite the FILE(s) or if -o=DIR is specified, write to
                     stripped FILE(s) to DIR instead.

-o, --out-dir=DIR    To be used together with -w, specify another directory to
                     write stripped FILE(s) to so that the original FILE(s) are
                     unedited.

--dry-run            If used together with -w, print list of FILE(s) that would
                     have been stripped. If -o is also specified, the
                     destination FILE(s) (separated by a comma) are included.

--confirm-overwrite  To be used together with -w, do not prompt for confirmation
                     before overwritting a FILE(s). Use with caution!

--preserve-newlines  Preserve newlines after comments are stripped.

--keep-protected     Keep protected comments (e.g. /*! and //!).

--keep-block         Keep block comments.

--keep-line          Keep line comments.
