Usage: stripcomments [OPTION]... [FILE/GLOB]...

If no FILE(s) are specified, it will default to STDIN.

Strip comments from FILE(s) and:
- print to STDOUT (default),
- overwrite the FILE(s), or
- write FILE(s) to another directory

OPTIONS:
-w, --write          Overwrite the FILE(s) or if -o=DIR is specified, write
                     stripped FILE(s) to DIR instead.

-o, --out-dir=DIR    To be used together with -w, specify another directory to
                     write stripped FILE(s) to so that the original FILE(s) are
                     left unedited.

--language=LANGUAGE  Specify the LANGUAGE (case insensitive) of the FILE(s).
                     JavaScript is the default if the LANGUAGE is not specified
                     and if it cannot be inferred from the file extension of the
                     FILE(s). The list of supported languages is specified at
                     the bottom.

--dry-run            If used together with -w, print list of FILE(s) that would
                     have been stripped. If -o is also specified, the
                     destination FILE(s) (separated by a comma) are printed too.

--confirm-overwrite  To be used together with -w, confirm all overwrites
                     without prompting. Use with caution!

--preserve-newlines  Preserve newlines after comments are stripped.

--only-first         Only remove the first comment. If used together with
                     --keep-protected, only the first non-protected comment is
                     removed.

--keep-protected     Keep protected comments (e.g. /*! and //!).

--keep-block         Keep block comments.

--keep-line          Keep line comments.

--help               Print help.

--version            Print version info.
